# Express Middleware Project

This project is a simple Express-based backend that serves a list of products through a RESTful API. It also includes a React frontend component to fetch and display the products.

## Features

- Backend built with Express.js
- RESTful API to serve product data
- Frontend React component to fetch and display products
- Integration with `axios` for HTTP requests

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: React, Axios
- **Tools**: npm

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd express-middleware

3. Install backend dependencies:
    npm install

4. Start the Express server:
    node server.js

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    cd frontend

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    npm install

3. Start the React development server:
    npm start

## Usage
- Ensure the backend server is running on http://localhost:5000.
- Access the React frontend at http://localhost:3000.

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/products: Fetches a list of products.

## Code Overview

1. Backend (server.js)

    - Sets up an Express server to handle API requests.
    - /api/products: Serves a mock list of products.

2. Frontend (ProductList.js)
    - React component that fetches product data from the backend.
    - Displays product name and price in a list.

3. Known Issues
    - Some Webpack-related issues may occur if attempting to bundle the backend. It is recommended to run the backend directly with Node.js.

4. Future Improvements
    - Add a database to serve dynamic product data.
    - Enhance error handling for API requests.
    - Improve the frontend with better styling and user interaction.

5. Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
